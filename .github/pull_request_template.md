### FastAPI Application Checklist (**Delete if PR is not relevant**)

- [ ] API follows RESTful principles (nouns in routes, proper use of verbs)
- [ ] All endpoints are async and use non-blocking I/O
- [ ] `/health` endpoint is implemented and returns 200 OK
- [ ] Long-running operations support both job polling (e.g., via /status/{job_id} or /progress/{job_id}) and optional webhooks (if a callback_url is provided).
  - [ ] If callback_url is present in the request payload, the service will POST job results to the specified URL upon completion.
  - [ ] If callback_url is not provided, the client can retrieve status and results via polling endpoints.
- [ ] Job results are persisted or recoverable if needed
- [ ] API schema (OpenAPI) is exposed and browsable at `/docs` or `/redoc`
- [ ] Branch name follows conventions (e.g., `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`) â€” do **not** use `dev` directly
