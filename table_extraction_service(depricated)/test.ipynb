      "莫和马伍德终于找到了那棵无名巨杉，这是一棵从来没有人尝试攀爬过的巨大的红杉树。红杉树的寿命可以超过两千年，是世界上最高的树种。\n",
      "Paragraph 19\n",
      "Mo and Marwood stood at the base of Nameless, peering upwards into its crown. The structure of any redwood tree is the opposite of most trees, whose branches get smaller towards the top. Nameless, this ancient giant of the forest, grew increasingly complicated and more massive higher off the ground.\n",
      "莫德和马伍德站在无名氏的底部，抬头仰望着它的树冠。任何红杉树的结构都与其他树木相反，其他树木的树枝在顶部会变得越来越小，而这座森林中的古老巨人无名氏则在更高的地方生长得更加复杂、粗壮。\n",
      "Paragraph 20\n",
      "The tree was about 100 metres tall with a diameter of about 3 metres near its base. The trunk was an enormous cylinder of soft crumbly bark. Far above the ground, a few small wispy branches popped out of the trunk, but there were no branches on its lower reaches. Higher up still, a tangle of limbs emerged and wandered out of sight, buried in clouds of foliage. Mo and Marwood couldn't see its top.\n",
      "这棵树大约有100米高，底部直径约有3米。树干是一根巨大的圆柱体，表皮是松软易碎的树皮。离地很远的地方，从树干上长出几根细小的枝丫，而低处则一根树枝也没有。再往上，纠结的枝条埋没在茂密的树叶中，消失在视线之外。墨和马伍德看不到它的顶端。\n",
      "Paragraph 21\n",
      "Marwood recalled that in ideal conditions, a redwood can grow from a seed into a tree that's an astonishing 16 metres tall in just its first 20 years of life, increasing in height by nearly a metre annually. After that, it grows faster still. Adding mass at an accelerating rate, it can exceed 75 cm in diameter at chest height in fewer than 60 years. The growth of redwoods generally slows down after the first 100 years, though by the age of eight hundred, they may have reached a height as tall as a 30-storey building. Redwoods are shade-tolerant. They can survive in dark places at the bottom of a forest, in the deep shade of their elders, where few other trees would survive. A small redwood living in deep shade hardly grows at all, but doesn't die; it goes into a kind of suspended animation. If it is hit by light, it once again grows with relentless speed. Nameless had clearly basked in light - it was huge.\n",
      "马沃德回忆说，理想条件下，红杉树从种子成长为一棵树仅需20年时间，高度就令人惊叹地达到16米，每年增长近一米。之后，它的生长速度还会更快。以加速的速度增加质量，不到60年，它在胸部高度的直径就能超过75厘米。不过，红杉树通常在头一百年后生长速度会放缓，但到了八百岁高龄时，它们的高度可能相当于一座30层楼高的建筑。红杉树耐阴。在森林底部那些光线昏暗的地方，在其长辈的浓荫之下，几乎没有其他树木能够存活，而红杉却可以生存下来。一棵小红杉如果生活在深阴处几乎不会生长，但也不会死亡；它进入了一种类似休眠的状态。一旦受到光照，它又会以惊人的速度生长起来。“无名氏”显然沐浴过阳光——它体型庞大。\n",
      "Paragraph 22\n",
      "'You aren't going to try to climb it, are you?' asked Marwood incredulously.\n",
      "马伍德难以置信地问道：“你不会想爬上去吧？”\n",
      "Paragraph 23\n",
      "No answer.\n",
      "没有回答。\n",
      "Paragraph 24\n",
      "Mo looked again at the lowest branch of a smaller tree standing next to Nameless. Without warning, he leapt, grabbed and swung himself up onto the branch in one fluid movement and began climbing upwards.\n",
      "莫行又看了一眼，旁边无名小树上最低的树枝，忽然一个飞跃，抓住树枝荡了上去，开始向上攀爬。\n",
      "Paragraph 25\n",
      "'I really don't think that's very smart,' Marwood warned from below.\n",
      "马伍德从下面警告说： “我认为这并不明智。”\n",
      "Paragraph 26\n",
      "Ten minutes later, Mo arrived at the top of the smaller tree. The tree had narrowed to a pole thinner than his wrist, and began swaying under his weight. Having got as high as he could go, Mo looked across at Nameless and spotted a spray of slender branches on the curving wall of its monstrous trunk. A little branch stuck out, directly in front of him. Mo wanted to grab that branch. He edged closer to it, and the smaller tree began to bend under his weight.\n",
      "十分钟后，莫言爬到了小树的顶端。此时这棵树已经细得如手腕般粗细，并且在他的重量下开始摇晃起来。莫言已经爬不上去，他扭头看向无名，只见那棵大树弯曲的树干上，有一簇纤细的枝条。其中一根枝条正好伸向自己这边，莫言想要抓住它，身体往前探了探，小树顿时发出“咯吱”的声音，似乎要断掉了一般。\n",
      "Paragraph 27\n",
      "There was a gap between the branch of the smaller tree and Nameless. From the ground, Mo hadn't noticed that gap, expecting that the little tree's branches touched the big tree's branches, providing a bridge to walk across. Mo studied the situation. If he could just reach out far enough, he might be able to grab that little branch on Nameless.\n",
      "那棵小树的枝丫与无名之间，有一段距离。莫在地面上，并没有注意到这个距离，还以为小树的枝丫碰到了大树的枝丫，可以搭成一座桥。他仔细观察了一下，只要再长出一段，就可以够到无名的那根小枝了。\n",
      "Paragraph 28\n",
      "Trying not to think about how high up he was, Mo focused his mind on the problem. The gap was really not very large, he thought. He would have to let go of the small redwood and make a leap up into the big tree, and grasp a branch with his hands, like a circus performer catching the bar of a swinging trapeze. He had to jump high, or his body wouldn't clear the branches of the smaller tree and he'd get tangled and would fall.\n",
      "沐鸣尽量不去想自己有多高的问题，集中精神来解决眼前的困难。沐鸣觉得这个距离其实也不是很大，他必须要松开小红树，然后跳到大榕树上面去，用手抓住一个树枝，就像马戏团的演员一样接住秋千上的横杆。但是要跳得高一点，不然自己的身体过不掉小红树的枝桠，会被缠住摔下来。\n",

There was a jerk and he found himself hanging from the branch by both hands, bouncing with his feet kicking the air. Swinging hand-over-hand, he got himself over to the trunk and climbed the next three precarious metres onto a stronger branch. 45\n",
      "他感到失重了，世界停止了。莫看到巨大的红杉树枝以慢动作向自己接近，并看到自己的手指向它伸去。突然一紧，他发现自己双手挂在树枝上，双脚在空中乱蹬。他用手倒立着移动到树干处，然后又爬上了三米高的一个更粗的枝桠。\n",
      "Paragraph 43\n",
      "He had arrived somewhere in the lower tiers of Nameless, just below the crown of the huge tree. The branches here were bigger and closer together. There was foliage everywhere - above, below, and on all sides - layer upon layer of leaves, like tents within tents. The tree hadn't looked so big from the ground. Climbing upwards slowly and steadily through the labyrinth, Mo lost sight of the ground. It felt as if he was passing through a membrane and entering another world. His senses were overwhelmed by an impression of life all around. Flaky, grey-green, and brownish plants, in all manner of shapes, hung from branches - drippy, frizzy, stringy, and hairy. He began picking pieces off, tucking them into his pocket. As he neared the upper surface of the redwood canopy, the lacework of branches glowed with varied shades of green and he broke out into the sunlight.\n",
      "他来到了无名之树下层的位置，已经接近这棵大树的树冠了。这里的枝干更加粗大，也更密集，上面长满了密密麻麻的树叶，从上到下，从左到右，层层叠叠，如同帐篷一般。从地面看的时候，还真没觉得这棵树有多大。在迷宫般的树干中慢慢往上攀爬，莫天悚已经看不到地面了，仿佛穿过了一层膜，进入了一个新的世界。他的感官被一种生命的感觉所包围。各种形状的灰绿色、褐色的苔藓状植物从树枝上垂下来，有的滴着水，有的蓬松，有的像绳子，有的像毛发。他开始摘取一些放进自己的口袋里。当他接近红杉树冠的顶部时，枝叶间透出斑驳的绿光，阳光照耀在他的身上。\n",

      "Paragraph 61\n",
      "Britta led me along a narrow path through a glade of birch trees, explaining as we walked why the couple want to share their passion for this beautiful forest environment with guests. We arrived at the Mirrorcube. The most striking of the treehouses, it's a glass box perched high in the forest. Like an architectural magic trick, it almost disappears into the foliage, so sharply are the surrounding trees reflected in it.\n",
      "布丽塔带我沿着一条狭窄的小径走过一片白桦林，边走边向我解释这对夫妇为什么想与游客分享他们对这片美丽森林环境的热情。我们来到了镜立方。这是所有树屋中最引人注目的一个，它是一个高高架在森林中的玻璃盒子。就像一种建筑魔术，它几乎消失在树叶中，因为周围的树木被如此清晰地倒映在其中，以至于整个树屋仿佛融入了周围的环境中。\n",
      "Paragraph 62\n",
      "Inside, the Mirrorcube, like the hotel's other treehouses, facilities are fairly basic, not stretching much beyond an environmentally-friendly toilet - meals and showers are taken at the guesthouse, over 10 minutes' walk away. Still, underfloor heating will keep it cosy through winter. Reflective cladding means no one can see in but you can see out - you have an almost 360-degree view of the surrounding trees. There's even a window in the ceiling to look up into the sky.\n",
      "内部，镜立方和其他树屋一样，设施相对简单，主要是一个环保厕所，用餐和淋浴需要前往大约十分钟路程外的住宿接待处。不过，地暖将确保冬季时的舒适度。反射型外墙材料使得别人无法向内窥视，而你可以向外观看，几乎可以全方位（360度）欣赏周围的树木景色。天花板上甚至还有一个天窗，让你可以仰望天空。\n",
      "Paragraph 63\n",
      "When I woke the next morning, it was a shock to find a bird seeming to be peering back at me through the glass. It was tempting to spend the day in my own little nest but I wanted to explore.\n",
      "当我第二天早晨醒来时，发现一只鸟似乎正在透过玻璃向我回望，这让我感到很惊讶。虽然诱惑着我想整天待在我的“小巢”里，但我还是想出去探索一番。\n",
      "Paragraph 64\n",
      "I went to take a peek at the Cabin, a sleek, organically-shaped space pod touched down in the treetops about 50 metres from the Mirrorcube. Also sleeping two, this one has a huge viewing platform - in summer you can actually sleep out under the open sky (safe from mosquitoes as they don't fly 10 metres up in the air). Just behind it is the four-person Bird's Nest, and the Blue Cone, scheduled for completion next month. A fifth and final treehouse in the collection, the UFO, opens at the end of October.\n",
      "我前往一探位于镜立方上方约50米处树顶上着陆的流线型有机形状太空舱小木屋。这个小木屋可住两人，拥有超大的观景平台——夏季时，你甚至可以在户外通宵露宿（不用担心蚊虫叮咬，因为它们不会飞到离地面十米高的地方）。其后是可住四人的鸟巢，以及预计将于下个月完工的蓝圆锥。第五个也是最后一个树屋“UFO”将于十月末开放。\n",
      "Paragraph 65\n",
      "Later, over breakfast, Kent talked enthusiastically about village walking tours where guests can stop for coffee, cake and conversation with a local family.\n",
      "后来，在早餐时，肯特热情地介绍了村里的徒步旅行路线，在这条路线上，游客可以停下来与当地的一户家庭一起喝咖啡、吃蛋糕和聊天。\n",

So, will I be visiting again? Absolutely.\n",
