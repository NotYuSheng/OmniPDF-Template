The growth of redwoods generally slows down after the first 100 years, though by the age of eight hundred, they may have reached a height as tall as a 30-storey building. Redwoods are shade-tolerant. They can survive in dark places at the bottom of a forest, in the deep shade of their elders, where few other trees would survive. A small redwood living in deep shade hardly grows at all, but doesn't die; it goes into a kind of suspended animation. If it is hit by light, it once again grows with relentless speed.

Also sleeping two, this one has a huge viewing platform - in summer you can actually sleep out under the open sky (safe from mosquitoes as they don't fly 10 metres up in the air). Just behind it is the four-person Bird's Nest, and the Blue Cone, scheduled for completion next month. A fifth and final treehouse in the collection, the UFO, opens at the end of October.",
          "translated_text": "我去看了看树屋小木屋（Cabins），它是一个流线型、有机形状的空间舱，降落在距离镜立方大约50米的树冠上。这个小木屋也可以住两个人，它有一个巨大的观景平台——在夏天，你甚至可以睡在露天的天空下（不用担心蚊子，因为它们不会飞到离地面10米高的地方）。它的后面是可容纳四人的鸟巢（Bird's Nest）和预计下个月完工的蓝锥体（Blue Cone）。第五个也是最后一个树屋——UFO，将于十月末开放。"
