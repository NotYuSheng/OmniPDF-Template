With their database encrypted and vital systems compromised, the firm grappled with a crippling loss of productivity. Projects were  delayed,  deadlines  missed,  and  client relations strained as ZTK struggled to regain their  footing  in  the  wake  of  the  ransomware attack.

        "text": "Mr Low, the Chief Executive Officer and founder of ZTK, was thankful that the company seemed to have gotten back on track after a ransomware attack nearly three months ago. That cybersecurity incident had struck at the very heart of ZTK, encrypting their database of clients, emails, and vital business information, and  brought  the  company  to  a  complete standstill. With their database encrypted and vital systems compromised, the firm grappled with a crippling loss of productivity. Projects were  delayed,  deadlines  missed,  and  client relations strained as ZTK struggled to regain their  footing  in  the  wake  of  the  ransomware attack.  The  IT  manager  suspected  that  the hackers might have also stolen  company data,  such  as  emails  and  business  records, but Mr Low simply could not deal with those problems  then.  His priority was  restoring normal business operations."
