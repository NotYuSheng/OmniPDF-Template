* **Consistency:** Adhering to a consistent style across all projects improves
  collaboration and reduces errors.
* **Performance:** While readability is paramount, code should be efficient.

# Gemini Guides
* **Comment Piority** Comments should be posted in order of severity, starting with CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM and finally LOW. All comments of higher severity must be posted before a comment of lower severity is posted.
* **Naming Conventions** Comments regarding naming conventions should be collated together by file. Each file should only have 1 comment for all naming convention changes to be made.
